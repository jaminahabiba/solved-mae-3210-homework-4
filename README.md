For this homework you are welcome to solve problem 1 by hand, without using programming or submitting code. However, you are <strong>required </strong>to solve problems 3-4 with programming, and a copy of your code must be submitted. Use of MS excel (or equivalent software) is acceptable and encouraged for problem 2; please include a copy of your final spreadsheet within your submitted PDF.

<ol>

 <li>Consider the optimization problem:</li>

</ol>

Maximize <em>f</em>(<em>x,y</em>) = −3<em>x </em>+ <em>y</em>

subject to the constraints <em>x</em><sup>2 </sup>+ <em>y </em>≤ 4<em>,</em>

−2<em>x </em>+ <em>y </em>≤ 0<em>, x </em>≥ 0<em>.</em>5<em>, y </em>≥ 0<em>.</em>

<ul>

 <li>Plot the feasible solution space in the <em>x </em>− <em>y </em></li>

 <li>Solve the optimization problem by using the graphical method.</li>

</ul>

<ol start="2">

 <li>An aerospace company is developing a new fuel additive for commercial airliners.The additive is composed of three ingredients: <em>X</em>, <em>Y </em>, and <em>Z</em>. For peak performance, the total amount of additive must be at least 6 mL/L of fuel. For safety reasons, the sum of the highly flammable <em>Y </em>and <em>Z </em>ingredients must not exceed 2.5 mL/L. In addition, for the additive to work, the amount of <em>Z </em>must be greater than or equal to twice the amount of <em>Y </em>, and the amount of <em>X </em>must be greater than or equal to three quarters of the amount of <em>Y </em>. If the cost per mL for the ingredients <em>X</em>, <em>Y </em>and <em>Z </em>is 20 cents, 3 cents, and 5 cents, respectively, use MS excel to determine the minimum cost of the additive mixture for each liter of fuel.</li>

 <li>Use least squares regression to fit a straight line to the data</li>

Along with the slope and intercept, compute the standard error of the estimate and the correlation coefficient. Plot that data and the regression line.
